# Image-Super-Resolution-Using-Autoencoders
A model that designs and trains an autoencoder to increase the resolution of images with Keras

In this project, I've used Keras with Tensorflow as its backend to train my own autoencoder, and use this deep learning powered autoencoder to significantly enhance the quality of images. That is, the designed neural network will create high-resolution images from low-res source images.
